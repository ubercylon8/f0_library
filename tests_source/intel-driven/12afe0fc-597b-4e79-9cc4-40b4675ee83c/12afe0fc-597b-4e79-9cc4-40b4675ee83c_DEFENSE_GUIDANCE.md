# Defense Guidance: LimaCharlie Timeout Validation Harness

## Executive Summary

This document provides defensive guidance for detecting long-running processes and timeout evasion techniques as demonstrated by the **LimaCharlie Timeout Validation Harness** utility test. While this is a diagnostic test rather than a security simulation, the behaviors it exhibits (extended execution times, staged delays, and process sequencing) are commonly observed in sandbox evasion and timing-based attacks.

## Threat Overview

### Attack Description

The timing-based execution pattern demonstrated by this test mirrors techniques used by malware for sandbox evasion:

- **Extended Execution Times** - Malware often waits extended periods to outlast sandbox analysis windows
- **Staged Delays** - Breaking execution into multiple timed stages to evade behavioral analysis
- **Time-Based Evasion** - Checking system uptime, time acceleration, or sleep skipping to detect sandboxes

While this specific test is a utility for validating LimaCharlie's timeout parameter, the underlying behaviors are relevant for detecting real-world sandbox evasion techniques.

    "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads"
)

foreach ($path in $paths) {
    if (Test-Path $path) {
        $acl = Get-Acl $path
        $rule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAuditRule(
            "Everyone", "Write,Delete,CreateFiles", "ContainerInherit,ObjectInherit",
            "None", "Success,Failure"
        )
        $acl.AddAuditRule($rule)
        Set-Acl $path $acl
    }
}
```

## Incident Response Playbook

### Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test ID** | 12afe0fc-597b-4e79-9cc4-40b4675ee83c |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | T1497.001 |
| **Severity** | LOW (utility test) |
| **Estimated Response Time** | 15-30 minutes |

### 1. Detection Triggers

| Alert Name | Trigger Criteria | Priority |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Long-Running Process | Process duration > 5 minutes | P3 |
| Suspicious Directory Activity | File operations in %TEMP%, %APPDATA%, Downloads | P2 |
| Sequential Stage Execution | Multiple child processes with delays | P3 |
| Timeout Harness Detection | Specific binary signature | P2 |

### 2. Initial Triage (First 5 minutes)

- [ ] **Verify alert is not a scheduled F0RT1KA test** (check for test framework indicators)
- [ ] **Determine scope** - Single host or multiple?
- [ ] **Check execution context** - Legitimate testing or unexpected?
- [ ] **Review parent process** - Was this launched from expected source?

**Triage Questions:**
1. Is this a scheduled security test or infrastructure validation?
2. Is the file located in a suspicious user-writable directory (%TEMP%, %APPDATA%, Downloads)?
3. What is the parent process of the long-running executable?

### 3. Containment (15 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions

- [ ] **Identify the process tree**
```powershell
# Get process and children
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq <PID>} | Format-List *
Get-WmiObject Win32_Process | Where-Object {$_.ParentProcessId -eq <PID>}
```

- [ ] **Check process duration**
```powershell
# Calculate process runtime
$proc = Get-Process -Id <PID>
$runtime = (Get-Date) - $proc.StartTime
Write-Host "Process running for: $runtime"
```

- [ ] **Preserve volatile evidence**
```powershell
# Create IR folder
$irPath = "C:\IR\$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss')"
New-Item -Path $irPath -ItemType Directory -Force

# Capture running processes
Get-Process | Export-Csv "$irPath\processes.csv" -NoTypeInformation

# Capture process tree
Get-WmiObject Win32_Process |
    Select-Object ProcessId, ParentProcessId, Name, CommandLine, CreationDate |
    Export-Csv "$irPath\process_tree.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

### 4. Evidence Collection

#### Critical Artifacts

| Artifact | Location | Collection Command |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Test execution logs | Working directory | `Copy-Item "$env:TEMP\*_log.json" -Destination "C:\IR\artifacts\" -Recurse` |
| Stage binaries | %TEMP%, %APPDATA%, Downloads | Preserve for analysis |
| Process dumps | Memory | `procdump -ma <pid> C:\IR\` |
| Event logs | System | `wevtutil epl Security C:\IR\Security.evtx` |

#### Timeline Generation
```powershell
# Export relevant event logs
$logs = @("Security", "System", "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational")
foreach ($log in $logs) {
    wevtutil epl $log "C:\IR\$($log -replace '/','-').evtx"
}

# Query process creation events for timeline
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName = 'Security'
    ID = 4688
    StartTime = (Get-Date).AddHours(-2)
} | Export-Csv "C:\IR\process_creation_events.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

### 5. Eradication

#### File Removal
```powershell
# Remove suspicious artifacts from user-writable directories (AFTER evidence collection)
$suspiciousPaths = @("$env:TEMP", "$env:APPDATA", "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Temp", "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads")
foreach ($dir in $suspiciousPaths) {
    Remove-Item -Path "$dir\stage-*.exe" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Remove-Item -Path "$dir\*_execution_log.json" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}
```

#### Process Termination
```powershell
# Terminate long-running suspicious processes
Get-Process | Where-Object {
    $_.Path -like "*\Temp\*" -or
    $_.Path -like "*\AppData\*" -or
    $_.Path -like "*\Downloads\*"
} | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "stage-*"} | Stop-Process -Force
```

### 6. Recovery

#### System Restoration Checklist

- [ ] Verify all test artifacts removed
- [ ] Confirm no persistence mechanisms created
- [ ] Validate system performance returned to normal
- [ ] Review EDR/AV connectivity

#### Validation Commands
```powershell
# Verify suspicious directories are clean
$suspiciousPaths = @("$env:TEMP", "$env:APPDATA", "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Temp", "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads")
foreach ($dir in $suspiciousPaths) {
    Write-Host "Checking $dir for stage binaries..."
    Get-ChildItem "$dir\stage-*.exe" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}

# Verify no suspicious test processes running
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Path -like "*stage-T1497*"}

# Verify system resources normal
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name, CPU, WorkingSet64
```

### 7. Post-Incident

#### Lessons Learned Questions

1. How was the long-running process detected?
2. Was the detection timely (within test window)?
3. What baseline is needed for process duration alerts?
4. Are timeout settings appropriate for security testing?

#### Recommended Improvements

| Area | Recommendation | Priority |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Detection | Implement process duration anomaly detection | MEDIUM |
| Prevention | Consider process execution time limits for untrusted binaries | LOW |
| Monitoring | Add user-writable directory monitoring to SIEM (%TEMP%, %APPDATA%, Downloads) | HIGH |
| Response | Pre-stage IR collection scripts for process analysis | MEDIUM |

## Detection Testing

### Validation Steps

1. **Deploy detection rules** to your SIEM/EDR
2. **Run F0RT1KA test** on a monitored endpoint with appropriate timeout
3. **Verify alerts fire** within expected timeframes
4. **Tune false positives** based on your environment

### Expected Alert Timeline

| Phase | Expected Alert | Timing |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Binary Extraction | File creation in user-writable directory | Immediate |
| Process Execution | NEW_PROCESS event | Immediate |
| Stage 1 Start | Child process creation | ~0 seconds |
| Stage 1 Duration Alert | Long-running process | ~2 minutes |
| Stage 2 Start | Child process creation | ~2 minutes |
| Stage 3 Start | Child process creation | ~4 minutes |
| Test Completion | Process termination | ~6 minutes |
